# This file is mine
This is a web app tool created for teams working collaboratively. You can Lock the file you are working on here so that anyone else willing to work in the same file contacts you before starting working.

### Basic Functionality:
* Add File/Directory you are working
* Lock File
* Release File
* See file's current lock details
* Access Rights control
* Ask to release file

### Architecture:
* **Front End Language:** We'll start with `JavaScript` and `jQuery` as scripting language, along with `HTML5` and `CSS3`.
* **Back End Language:** We'll start with `PHP-7` as backend
* **Database:** We'll be using another github project [FileBase](https://github.com/tmarois/Filebase) for storage of the data.
