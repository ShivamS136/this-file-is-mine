# This file is mine
This is a web app tool created for teams working collaboratively. You can Lock the file you are working on here so that anyone else willing to work in the same file contacts you before starting working.

### Basic Functionality:
* Add File/Directory you are working
* Lock File
* Release File
* Delete File
* Access Rights control
* Ask to release file

### Architecture:
* **Front End Language:** I'll start with `JavaScript` and `jQuery` as scripting language, along with `HTML5` and `CSS3`.
* **Back End Language:** I'll start with `PHP` as backend but I'll try to move to `Node.JS` and `Express.JS`
* **Database:** I'll try to keep everything in flat files, in JSON or CSON manner. Atomicity is a problem in this but as I am trying to create this tool for small/middle sized teams so this should not be the problem.
